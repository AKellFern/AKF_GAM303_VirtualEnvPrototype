# AKF_GAM303_VirtualEnvPrototype

A virtual environment prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the GAM 303: Design of Virtual Game Environments course at Southern New Hampshire University. This project explores interactive design, level prototyping, interface flow, and system iteration using Blueprint scripting.

---

## Project Overview

This prototype focuses on foundational environment design and interaction systems within a scoped level. Emphasis was placed on rapid iteration, usability, and the application of design theory to interactive spaces.

Key areas explored include:
- Source control and versioning practices
- Rapid prototyping under constrained timelines
- Interactive level mechanics (doors, triggers, pickups)
- UI flow, player feedback, and basic system balancing

---

## Implemented Systems

- Interactive doors and trigger-based interactions
- Basic UI elements and layout experimentation
- Early pickup and interaction logic
- Iterative level layout and flow adjustments

This project demonstrates an understanding of environment-focused design workflows and iterative development in Unreal Engine.
